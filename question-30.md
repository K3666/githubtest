Write a program for loan calculations. Your program should ask the user for three pieces of information (with three seperate input() functions:)

Total amount of loan.
Annual interest rate. (Assume that the interest rate is a positive integer. For example 5 means that annual interest is 5% (five percent) per year.
Total duration of loan in years.
Your Program should use the two functions that you implented in part 1 and 2 of this exercise and display the follwoing information about the loan.

In the first first line show the amount of loan and interest rate.
In the second line show duration of the loan and monthly payment.
In each of the following lines show the Loan balance and total amount paid for each year.
Example 1: assuming that user inputs the following numbers in response to your questions:

Enter loan amount: 1000.0
Enter annual interest rate (percent): 10.0
Enter loan duration in years: 5

    
The output of your program should be:

LOAN AMOUNT: 1000 INTEREST RATE (PERCENT): 10
DURATION (YEARS): 5 MONTHLY PAYMENT: 21
YEAR: 1 BALANCE: 837 TOTAL PAYMENT 254
YEAR: 2 BALANCE: 658 TOTAL PAYMENT 509
YEAR: 3 BALANCE: 460 TOTAL PAYMENT 764
YEAR: 4 BALANCE: 241 TOTAL PAYMENT 1019
YEAR: 5 BALANCE: 0 TOTAL PAYMENT 1274
  
Important notes:
 * Use floating point numbers in your calculations.
 * Convert all the numbers to int only for printing them.
